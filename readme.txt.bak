C++ language was designed with the idea of adding Classes to C
C++ was intially called C with classes
The bigger less than readbility and more is the maintanence hence
C is procedural oriented langauge C++ is object orientated language
functions can either use local or global values

Class is a template to create objects
OOP treats data as critical elements
Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects
Objects are run time entities created using Class
Data Encapsulation= Wrapping of data and functions into single unit
Data Abstraction- Hide low level design(which is the logic ) which we do not want to store
Inheritance-Properties of one class can be inherited from others
Polymorphism=Abitliy to take multiple forms
Dynamic/Data Binding-code which will execute is not know until the program runs
